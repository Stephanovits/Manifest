The focus of this project is to create an application that allows wards to schedule transportation jobs as well as the executing staff to report on the status of these jobs.
The overall objective of the application is to remove the need for phone calls by sharing information equally between all parties involved.

A demo of the application can be found here: https://birkbeckuol-my.sharepoint.com/personal/sschra01_student_bbk_ac_uk/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?login_hint=sschra01%40student%2Ebbk%2Eac%2Euk&id=%2Fpersonal%2Fsschra01%5Fstudent%5Fbbk%5Fac%5Fuk%2FDocuments%2FMSc%20Final%20Year%20Project%2C%20Manifest
